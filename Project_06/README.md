<h1>Data Visualization Project with Tableau</h1>

In this project, I will create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. 
This project examins airport delays for O'Hare, San Francisco and Atlanta Int'l Airports in 2018. <br><br>

The data set is obtained from the <a href='https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp'>Bureau of Transportation Statistics </a> website. 

Please refer to <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/arata.kagan#!/vizhome/Udacity_Flight_Delays_project/Story1">this link</a>for the project.
