<h1>Data Visualization Project with Tableau</h1>

In this project, I will create an explanatory data visualization with Tableau from a flight delay data set. Main objectives are O'Hare, San Francisco and Atlanta Int'l Airports in 2018. My aim for this project is to communicate a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set.<br>

The data set is obtained from the <a href='https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp'>Bureau of Transportation Statistics </a> website.
