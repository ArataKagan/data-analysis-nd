<H1>Inferential Statistics Project: Test A Perceptual Phenomenon</H1>

In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental
psychology called the Stroop Effect. Please refer to <a href='https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-stroop-effect-2795832'> this link </a>
for more details about the Stroop Effect. I will identify components of an experiment, use a
descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample, and set up a hypothesis test, 
make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results.
