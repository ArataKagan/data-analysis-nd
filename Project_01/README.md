In this project, I will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental
psychology called the Stroop Effect. Please refer to <a href='https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-stroop-effect-2795832'> this link </a>
for more detail about the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the
experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task,
then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected
from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics
describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of
your hypotheses.
