<h1>Red Wine Exploratory Data Analysis with R</h1>

In this project, I am going to conduct an exploratory data analysis for red wine dataset and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of chemical properties to examine what causes better quality of red wines.

This dataset has 1599 observations. The following are descriptions of each variable:

1 - `Fixed acidity`: most acids involved with wine are fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily.)

2 - `Volatile acidity`: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high a level can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.

3 - `Citric acid`: found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wine.

4 - `Residual sugar`: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. It is rare to find wine with less than 1 gram/liter and wine with greater than 4.5 grams/liter are considered sweet.

5 - `Chlorides`: the amount of salt in the wine.

6 - `Free sulfur dioxide`: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.

7 - `Total sulfur dioxide`: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.

8 - `Density`: the density of wine is close to that of water depending on the percent of alcohol and sugar content.

9 - `pH`: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.

10 - `Sulphates`: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, which acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

11 - `Alcohol`: the percent alcohol content of the wine.

12 - Quality (score between 0 and 10.)
