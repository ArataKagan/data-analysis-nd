<h1>Titanic Dataset Investigation Project</h1>

As part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree's Intro to Data Analysis project, 
I will examine the Titanic Survival rate dataset. 

<h3>This dataset contains the following columns:</h3>

`Passenger ID`: the number that differentiates passengers<br>
Survived: Whether the passenger survived the accident or not (independent variable)<br>
0 = No, 1 = Yes<br>
Pclass: Passenger class which indicates the passenger's socioeconomic class.<br>
1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd<br>
Name: Passenger's name<br>
Sex: Passenger's gender<br>
Age: Passenger's age<br>
SibSp: Number of siblings and spouses.<br>
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister<br>
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)<br>
Parch: Number of parents and children.<br>
Parent = mother, father<br>
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson<br>
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.<br>
Ticket: Passenger's ticket number<br>
Fare: The price of fare the passenger paid for<br>
Cabin: Passenger's cabin number<br>
Embarked: The port the passenger embarked from<br>
S: Southampton, C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown<br>
