<h1>Titanic Dataset Investigation Project</h1>

As part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree's Intro to Data Analysis project, 
I will examine the Titanic Survival rate dataset. 

This dataset contains the following columns:

Passenger ID: the number that differentiates passengers
Survived: Whether the passenger survived the accident or not (independent variable)
0 = No, 1 = Yes
Pclass: Passenger class which indicates the passenger's socioeconomic class.
1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's gender
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings and spouses.
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
Parch: Number of parents and children.
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
Ticket: Passenger's ticket number
Fare: The price of fare the passenger paid for
Cabin: Passenger's cabin number
Embarked: The port the passenger embarked from
S: Southampton, C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown
